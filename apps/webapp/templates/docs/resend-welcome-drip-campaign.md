This template contains a [customEvent](https://docs.trigger.dev/triggers/custom-events) Trigger that will send an example drip email campaign using [Resend.com](https://resend.com/) and [react.email](https://react.email/)

> Resend.com is currently in private beta, but if you signup for their waitlist, give us a shout on [our Discord](https://discord.gg/CzBqJnYq9r) and we'll help you get in.

```ts
new Trigger({
  // Give your Trigger a stable ID
  id: "resend-welcome-drip-campaign",
  name: "Resend.com: Welcome Drip Campaign",
  // Trigger on a custom event, see https://docs.trigger.dev/triggers/custom-events
  on: customEvent({
    name: "new.user",
    // Use zod to verify event payload. See https://docs.trigger.dev/guides/zod
    schema: z.object({ id: z.string(), email: z.string(), name: z.string() }),
  }),
  // The run functions gets called once per "new.user" event
  async run(event, ctx) {
    // Send the initial welcome email. See https://docs.trigger.dev/integrations/apis/resend/actions/send-email
    await resend.sendEmail("üìß welcome", {
      from: FROM_EMAIL,
      replyTo: REPLY_TO_EMAIL,
      to: event.email,
      subject: "Welcome to Acme.dev!",
      react: <WelcomeEmail name={event.name} />,
    });

    // Wait for 1 hour. See https://docs.trigger.dev/functions/delays
    await ctx.waitFor("‚è≤", { hours: 1 });

    // Send a tips email
    await resend.sendEmail("üìß tips", {
      from: FROM_EMAIL,
      replyTo: REPLY_TO_EMAIL,
      to: event.email,
      subject: "3 tips to get the most out of Acme.dev",
      react: <TipsEmail name={event.name} />,
    });

    return event;
  },
}).listen();
```

## ‚úçÔ∏è Customize

We've included two example emails that you should customize to your needs. You can use the react.email preview server locally to preview the emails and live edit them.

You can easily run the email preview server and visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000):

```sh
npm run emails
```

You can now edit the emails:

- [welcomeEmail.tsx](src/emails/welcomeEmail.tsx)
- [tipsEmail.tsx](src/emails/tipsEmail.tsx)

### From, Reply To, and Subject lines

You can customize the `from` and `replyTo` options by setting the `FROM_EMAIL` and `REPLY_TO_EMAIL` environment variables:

```
FROM_EMAIL="Trigger.dev <eric@email.trigger.dev>"
REPLY_TO_EMAIL="Eric <eric@trigger.dev>"
```

To customize the subject lines, edit the [index.tsx](src/index.tsx) file.

### Customize the drippiness

You can customize the delays between emails by editing the `ctx.waitFor` call:

```ts
await ctx.waitFor("‚è≤", { hours: 1 });
```

You can also make your drip campaigns smarter by connecting to your own database and conditionally sending different emails depending on what the user does. To see an example of that check out our [resend example](https://github.com/triggerdotdev/trigger.dev-examples/blob/main/src/examples/resend.tsx).

## üì∫ Go Live

After you are happy with your campaign and deploy it live to Render.com (or some other hosting service), you can send custom events that Trigger your workflow using the [sendEvent](https://docs.trigger.dev/reference/send-event) function from the `@trigger.dev/sdk`, or simply by making requests to our [`events`](https://docs.trigger.dev/api-reference/events/sendEvent) API endpoint.

Here is an example of sending the custom event to trigger the workflow contained in this repo using `fetch`:

```ts
const eventId = ulid();
const event = {
  name: "new.user",
  payload: {
    id: "user_1234",
    email: "eric@trigger.dev",
    name: "Eric",
  },
};

const response = await fetch("https://app.trigger.dev/api/v1/events", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.TRIGGER_API_KEY}`,
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    id: eventId,
    event,
  }),
});
```
