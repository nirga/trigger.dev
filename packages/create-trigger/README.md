## âœ¨ Create Trigger - Get started writing Trigger.dev code quickly

Trigger.dev is an open source platform that makes it easy to create event-driven background tasks directly your codebase.

You can run these tasks (or "workflows" as we like to cal them) in your existing Node.js repo, but if you don't have one of those (ðŸ‘‹ Next.js devs) or you just want to try us out without the setup, this `create-trigger` CLI will scaffold out a project for you in just a few seconds, either starting from scratch or using one of our many [templates](https://app.trigger.com/templates).

## ðŸ’» Usage

To scaffold out a new project using `create-trigger`, run any of the following three commands and answer the prompts:

### npm

```sh
npx create-trigger@latest
```

### yarn

```sh
yarn create trigger
```

### pnpm

```sh
pnpm create trigger@latest
```

You can also specify the [template](https://app.trigger.com/templates) you want to use by passing an argument to the command, like so:

```sh
npx create-trigger@latest github-stars-to-slack
```

### `src/index.ts`

All your Trigger.dev workflow code will be in here, and this is the part you can start customizing.

### `.env`

If provided, we'll save your development API Key here so running the project can connect to our servers.

### `render.yaml`

A [Render.com](https://render.com) Blueprint file that makes it easy to deploy your repo as a Background Worker.

### `README.md`

Contains useful instructions for getting started with the repo, including how to customize it, running it locally, testing it, and deploying it.
